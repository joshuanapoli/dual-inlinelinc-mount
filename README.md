Insteon In-LineLinc Dual Gang Mount
===================================

Insteon In-LineLinc Dimmers are good for controlling built-in lighting in my home, but their installation leaves something to be desired. The device must be associated with another device (such as a light switch) using its SET button. But once the device is installed in an electrical box, the button is not available. The large size of the device can also make it hard to get a large enough junction box.

This bracket is used to mount two 70x45x24mm In-LineLinc devices in a dual gang junction box. The bracket can fasten to a standard dual gang face plate.


Materials
---------

Taulman Alloy 910 works well for these parts. It holds self tapping plastic screws well. It is less flammable than ABS (UL 94 V2, UL 94 HB). Note that this cover will nevertheless likely be more flammable and have a lower melting temperature than a commercial UL-listed cover.
